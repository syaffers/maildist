# Visualizing the distribution time of promotional emails

This was a coding exercise which turned out to produce some very interesting
visualizations.

See this [reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/74topf/visualizing_promotional_email_distribution_time_oc/) for the whole discourse.

There are some interesting patterns, check out the graph below

## How this was made

See the IPython Notebook `MailDist.ipynb` for the way the visualizations were
produced and for extra visualizations!
